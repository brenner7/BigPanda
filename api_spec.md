**Response Codes**  
When an API request is successful, the BigPanda server sends a response to indicate that it received the event. If a request fails, the response code may help with troubleshooting the integration.  

Response                   |	Description  
---------------------------|-------------  
`200 OK`	| Success.  
`201 Created` |	New resource created.  
`204 No Content` |	The server successfully processed the request and is not returning any content.  
`400 Bad Request`	| Default code for invalid requests. For example, it is missing a mandatory field. Check the error message and ensure that the JSON includes the correct parameters.  
`401 Unauthorized` |	Token is invalid or missing. Check that the request includes the correct HTTP headers.  
`404 Not Found` |	Requested endpoint isn't available. Ensure that the request uses one of the API endpoints specified in the documentation.  
`409 Conflict`	| Request cannot be performed due to a conflict. For example, attempting to resolve an incident that's already resolved.  
`500 Internal Server Error` |	Default code for errors that occur due to problems on BigPanda servers. Retry the request after some time.  
`501 Not Implemented`	| Unsupported method.  

**Response Body Parameters**  
For a successful API call, the response body will include the response code and comment_id value.

Executing these commands in Shell, should present the results in BigPanda almost instantaneously.  

To use these commands, the user must replace the token and app key with the corresponding values in BigPanda, and must specify that the Content-type is application/json.
